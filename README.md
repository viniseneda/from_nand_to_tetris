## From Nand To Tetris

![project9](/cel.png)

submission to the Nand2tetris course on coursera. It goes from the logic gates in project 01, to a simple operating system in project 12.

In project 9 we had to develop a program in a java inspired programing language called jack. I implemented a generator of elementary cellular automata (which is ilustrated in the image above).
